            <h1>How to Properly Change Guitar Strings</h1>
            <p>Beginner guitarists sooner or later face the reality of having to replace strings on an acoustic guitar. Most often, of course, this happens at home in a comfortable setting, but sometimes it needs to be done in the field. So if you just decided yesterday to become a famous musician, it's better to learn in advance about how and how often you need to change strings.</p>
            <h3>Types of Strings</h3>
            <p>Strings are divided into two types: metal and synthetic. The first are made of steel and have a winding, which, in turn, is made of various alloys and wound on the core in different ways. And the second are, in most cases, nylon.
                Roughly speaking, acoustic guitars are purposefully manufactured for specific strings. And this is related to tension. For example, metal has much stronger tension than nylon. Consequently, guitars designed for steel strings have a reinforced neck and rigid body. You can put nylon on such an instrument, but it's unlikely to impress with its sound since it's much softer than metal. But the reverse situation, when steel strings are put on a classical guitar designed for synthetics, is better not to try in practice, unless, of course, the goal is to damage the instrument. Strong tension can simply warp the neck not designed for this and tear out the bridge pin.
                Distinguishing one guitar from another is simple. You need to carefully examine the bridge and neck. Nylon is attached to a special bridge, while steel strings are attached to the guitar body with additional reinforcement inside the instrument.
                Instructions for changing strings on an acoustic guitar. Remember that strings are changed all at once, even if only one has failed.</p>
            <h3>Changing Metal Strings</h3>
            <p>So, if after the previous point, you determined that you're holding an instrument suitable for metal strings and notice their complete or partial absence, you should follow these installation steps.
                Buy suitable strings. You can choose exactly the same ones as last time, or you can try something new. This article describes what types they come in.
                After that, you need to loosen the tuning pegs on the instrument. Some use special tools, so-called string winders, while others rely on their own hands. What to choose is up to you.
                After completely loosening the string, you need to completely unwind it and remove it from the tuning peg.
                Once the work with the neck is finished, move to the bridge. You need to remove the pins holding the string. There are also special tools for this procedure, but some manage with regular pliers, although this can affect the instrument's appearance.
                After removing the pin, the string is completely removed from the instrument.
                It's good at this stage to wipe the instrument from dust, clean the neck and body.</p>
            <h3>Changing Nylon Strings</h3>
            <p>And if you determined that you have a classical guitar, with complete or partial absence of strings, then to be able to play it again, you should take the following steps.
                As in the previous case, everything starts with buying strings. In this article, you can read about how to properly choose synthetics.
                Once you have the new strings, you can start. First, you need to remove the strings from the acoustic guitar. Carefully unwind the tuning pegs until you get the end. There is, of course, a more radical way – simply cutting the strings. But such an approach can not only damage the instrument but also slightly injure the musician. More precisely, cut hands and possibly other body parts. So it's better to choose a slower but safer way.
                After unwinding, we move to the bridge and untie the knots, freeing the strings.
                Clean the instrument from dust. Everything needs to be wiped – both the neck and body.
                Now thread one end of the string through the bridge and secure it with a knot. You're lucky if your set of strings comes with special balls at the ends. Then it's elementary – the ball won't allow the string to leave the instrument. But if not, then you'll have to practice tying the right knots a bit.
                When you've succeeded in the previous step, move to the other end of the string. It needs to be inserted into the hole in the tuning peg. And after that – tighten and perform similar processes with other strings. Don't forget to cut the protruding ends at the very end.
                In the case of nylon, you can not follow the rule of not overtightening, and even contradict it. Synthetics are several times softer than metal, and they can be painlessly tightened a little more than required.</p>

            <h1>Guitar Riffs</h1>
            <p>Rock music has long been more than something that angers parents and calls for rebellion. Rock is not only a certain "jeans" aesthetic, which found room for both guys in ties like The Beatles and painted brunettes from Black Veil Brides. But both used guitar riffs in their work. Moreover, all rock is about 70 percent, if not more, consists exclusively of catchy, memorable riffs on guitars. Next, we'll look at what a riff is in rock music, and how to use it, types of riffs, and also examine the tabs of the most famous ones that any self-respecting rocker should know. So, let's begin.
            </p>
            <h3>What is a Guitar Riff. Definition. Main Uses</h3>
            <p>A riff is called a short constantly repeating musical fragment. A riff can be both an introduction and any other part of the song: climax, accompaniment, ending, etc. In rock and blues, riffs are played in the lower register and used as accompaniment to the song, so on guitar they are most often played on the lower strings and this is done by the rhythm guitarist.
                Some guitar riffs have become so iconic that entire songs are recognized by them. For example, Come as you are or Smoke On The Water.
            </p>
            <h3>Types of Riffs</h3>
            <p>Riffs can be single-voice, chord-based, in "open" keys, performed based on the fifth, blues in E major, as well as riffs with a "pedal" tone. However, this is a conditional classification, as the same riff can be a combination of several fragments. Creating your own riff is not that difficult – the main thing is not to be afraid of experiments.
            </p>
            <h3>Riffs in Open Keys (E, A or D)</h3>
            <p>These riffs are used in music that came from blues, rock and roll, blues-rock, hard rock, glam rock, etc. They are performed with clean sound or with distortion effect. Often during playing, palm muting with the right hand is applied. The basis for such rhythmic figures is the power chord, i.e., a chord consisting of the root note and fifth with the addition of various scale degrees during playing. The keys in which riffs are played are mainly "open" - E, D, A. The most popular key is A major.
                The A power chord in the "open" position looks as follows:
                The first (index) finger during riff performance mutes strings 3, 2, and 1.
                The thumb mutes string 6.
